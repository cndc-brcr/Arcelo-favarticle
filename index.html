                <h3>Going Together - For Youth Creativity and Well-Being</h3>
                <p><b>UNESCO</b> and <b>SEVENTEEN</b> Unite for Youth Creativity and Well-Being
                  In June 2024, UNESCO and K-pop sensation SEVENTEEN launched an innovative global initiative, <b>"Going Together – For Youth Creativity and Well-Being,"</b> aimed at empowering young people through creative and community-focused projects.

                <p>At its core, the <i>Going Together</i> campaign is a rallying cry for young changemakers to address pressing societal issues through innovative projects. With grants ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, the initiative provides resources for youth-led endeavors in three key areas: building confidence and resilience through music, arts, and sports; creating vibrant, creative communities; and improving youth mental health and well-being. This multi-faceted approach aligns with UNESCO’s mandate and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those focused on education, equality, and climate action. During the ceremony, member <b>Joshua</b> expressed the group’s honor at representing youth, emphasizing their journey of growth and their bond with their fanbase, <b>CARATs</b>. The group aims to inspire young people to pursue their dreams while fostering supportive communities.</p>
